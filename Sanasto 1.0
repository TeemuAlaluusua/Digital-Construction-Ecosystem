Overview
At the heart of bSDD is a canonical database, where all dictionaries can be related to each other. The main way to access the bSDD is through its APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This is how most BIM software and other apps can use the data stored in the bSDD. Apart from that, there is the bSDD Search page, where people can look up the content. Authors can publish content to bSDD through the API or the bSDD Manage portal. To upload, please register your organisation using the organisation registration form.
